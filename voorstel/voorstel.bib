In this work, we analyze Dark Patterns in 240 popular mobile apps and conduct an online experiment with 589 users on how they perceive Dark Patterns in such apps. The results of the analysis show that 95\% of the analyzed apps contain one or more forms of Dark Patterns and, on average, popular applications include at least seven different types of deceiving interfaces. The online experiment shows that most users do not recognize Dark Patterns, but can perform better in recognizing malicious designs if informed on the issue. We discuss the impact of our work and what measures could be applied to alleviate the issue.},

  abstractnote = {Dark patterns are user interface design strategies that benefit an online service by tricking users into making unintentional decisions. Dark patterns have been used to trick users into financial decisions that they did not intend to and disclosing personal information. They have been found in video games, social media platforms, mobile applications and shopping websites et cetera. Previous research in the aforementioned fields has attempted to tackle these problems. However, the video streaming sector remains understudied. To capture dark patterns in the video streaming sector, YouTube, Dailymotion, Disney+, Prime Video, and Netflix were investigated. A comparison between dark pattern applicability in free versus paid-for services and differences in their implementation between mobile and desktop was done. An inspection method was employed to evaluate and capture the dark patterns in the streaming services’ user interfaces. By using previously established literature on dark patterns, an instructional and informative protocol was created, which guided the research. Findings include that in total, these services contain 14 dark patterns. Both paid and free video streaming services contain dark patterns. On paid services, these patterns mainly centre around the subscription aspect of the service. Dark patterns are present on both desktop and mobile platforms, with mobile versions potentially being more invasive. Conclusions are that dark patterns are prevalent in the video streaming sector despite being technically illegal; they affect cookie preferences, subscription processes, and app usage. There are minimal differences in the frequency of dark patterns between paid and free services. We contribute with the identification of dark patterns in an understudied context, how monetization model and device type affect dark pattern manifestation, and a systematic method that proves effective for capturing and describing dark patterns.},

Prior work identified these patterns in websites and mobile apps, but little is known about how the design of platforms might impact dark pattern manifestations and related human vulnerabilities. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of mobile application, mobile browser, and web browser versions of 105 popular services to investigate variations in dark patterns across modalities. We perform manual tests, identify dark patterns in each service, and examine how they persist or differ by modality. Our findings show that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms, and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control. We conclude by discussing broader implications for policymakers and practitioners, and provide suggestions for furthering dark patterns research.},

  abstract  = {Online services pervasively employ manipulative designs (i.e., dark patterns) to influence users to purchase goods and subscriptions, spend more time on-site, or mindlessly accept the harvesting of their personal data. To protect users from the lure of such designs, we asked: are users aware of the presence of dark patterns? If so, are they able to resist them? By surveying 406 individuals, we found that they are generally aware of the influence that manipulative designs can exert on their online behaviour. However, being aware does not equip users with the ability to oppose such influence. We further find that respondents, especially younger ones, often recognise the ”darkness” of certain designs, but remain unsure of the actual harm they may suffer. Finally, we discuss a set of interventions (e.g., bright patterns, design frictions, training games, applications to expedite legal enforcement) in the light of our findings.},

  abstract  = {When people interact with digital technologies, their choices are often driven in a specific direction, mainly through user interface designs---e.g., specific layout or content. Such guiding practices might be useful. They may help find desired information quicker or proceed with a given task more efficiently. Ultimately, they may contribute to improved usability and satisfaction that users experience during the interaction. However, some of such designs can mislead, manipulate, or trick users into choices that are beneficial to service providers but not necessarily to users. These designs are known as dark patterns, and their success relies on psychological characteristics, particularly exploiting decision-making processes' weaknesses. The applicability of dark patterns is traditionally associated with e-commerce or marketing strategies aiming to increase sales. However, research shows that dark patterns also extend to online privacy, resulting in harms reaching beyond economic loss and exploiting the vulnerabilities of individuals. This chapter reviews research on dark patterns and explains some of the psychological bases that dark patterns rely on. The chapter focuses on privacy issues and discusses possible ways of preventing the detrimental effects of dark patterns, including their effects on business.},

  abstract     = {As digital interfaces become increasingly prevalent, a series of ethical issues have surfaced, with dark patterns emerging as a key research focus. These manipulative design strategies are widely employed in User Interfaces (UI) with the primary aim of steering user behavior in favor of service providers, often at the expense of the users themselves. This paper aims to address three main challenges in the study of dark patterns: inconsistencies and incompleteness in classification, limitations of detection tools, and inadequacies in data comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework, called the Dark Pattern Analysis Framework (DPAF). Using this framework, we construct a comprehensive taxonomy of dark patterns, encompassing 64 types, each labeled with its impact on users and the likely scenarios in which it appears, validated through an industry survey. When assessing the capabilities of the detection tools and the completeness of the dataset, we find that of all dark patterns, the five detection tools can only identify 32, yielding a coverage rate of merely 50\%. Although the four existing datasets collectively contain 5,566 instances, they cover only 32 of all types of dark patterns, also resulting in a total coverage rate of 50\%. The results discussed above suggest that there is still significant room for advancement in the field of dark pattern detection. Through this research, we not only deepen our understanding of dark pattern classification and detection tools, but also offer valuable insights for future research and practice in this field.},

  abstract     = {Dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions. They typically exploit cognitive biases and prompt online consumers to purchase goods and services that they do not want or to reveal personal information they would prefer not to disclose. This article provides the first public evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the authors’ two large-scale experiments in which representative samples of American consumers were exposed to dark patterns. In the first study, users exposed to mild dark patterns were more than twice as likely to sign up for a dubious service as those assigned to the control group, and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four times as likely to subscribe. Moreover, whereas aggressive dark patterns generated a powerful backlash among consumers, mild dark patterns did not. Less educated subjects were significantly more susceptible to mild dark patterns than their well-educated counterparts. The second study identified the dark patterns that seem most likely to nudge consumers into making decisions that they are likely to regret or misunderstand. Hidden information, trick question, and obstruction strategies were particularly likely to manipulate consumers successfully. Other strategies employing loaded language or generating bandwagon effects worked moderately well, while still others such as “must act now” messages did not make consumers more likely to purchase a costly service. Our second study also replicated a striking result in the first experiment, which is that where dark patterns were employed the cost of the service offered to consumers became immaterial. Decision architecture, not price, drove consumer purchasing decisions. The article concludes by examining legal frameworks for addressing dark patterns. Many dark patterns appear to violate federal and state laws restricting the use of unfair and deceptive practices in trade. Moreover, in those instances where consumers enter into contracts after being exposed to dark patterns, their consent could be deemed voidable under contract law principles. The article also proposes that dark pattern audits become part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s consent decree process. Dark patterns are presumably proliferating because firms’ proprietary A-B testing has revealed them to be profit maximizing. We show how similar A-B testing can be used to identify those dark patterns that are so manipulative that they ought to be deemed unlawful.},
